# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design
- Brian Bentley 12/8/2022

This repository will contain some of the files and work for my System Analysis and Design course. Ironically I do this type of stuff for work now so this course was pretty simple. I enjoy designing and fleshing out systems before writing the actual code and seeing a clear set of objectives. This class was great, and I look forward to doing more work like this.

In this class we were tasked with doing a high level simple design of a System called DriverPass. After interviewing the customer, we were able to gather enough data to start creating a functional and non functional requirement document and set system limitations. 

Taking this, we were tasked with creating UML Sequence, Activity, and Class diagrams for the system. Using one diagram we would breakdown tasks further and further until we were able to create objects. From these class diagrams you can really break things down into private and public methods and then start writing the code rather quickly. 

We were tasked in our final project to write a presentation up, as well as a system diagram document to ascertain our understanding of the subject matter.
